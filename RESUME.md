PROJECTS

PowerScore
Developed a serverless function using Flask, for the purpose of aggregating team win-loss statistics into an easily understandable "PowerScore." Site was deployed via Vercel in June 2024, and has been receiving regular updates since. Python backend involves a complex statistical deviation analysis algorithm, which uses probabilistic inference to notice trends in data spanning several months. Data was provided to the algorithm by requesting from the RECF RobotEvents API. On the front end, various JavaScript functions allowed the service to: cache team data in the browser for faster page loads, save team links as in-site bookmarks to reach their data faster, and interact with an external database to track a "Kudos" counter on team pages.
SweetSpot
Developing a cross-platform web app with React, designed with the purpose of allowing users to discover local stores that have registered their location with a verified account. Recommendations are served to the user based on a proprietary "NearLike" algorithm, which aggregates proximity, reported veritability, and alignment to the user's interests into a single score. Development of this algorithm involved machine (reinforcement) learning that modified the parameters of the algorithm until the recommendations were as intended. UI was also designed by me with Figma, which allowed for effective interface design that controlled the user experience to balance navigational efficiency with visual clarity.
VEX Robotics, Visual Autonomous-Path Generation
Developed a program for generating autonomous path code to guide a drivebase without human-programmed instructions. Designed a file format for saving and loading data into a spline-based path editor, which interfaced with a Pure Pursuit loop on the drivebase (written in C++), designed to follow the bezier path. Program decreased robot development times and allowed for more time to experiment various movement strategies on the field.
Learned complex UI/UX development, 3-dimensional vector math, and the implementation of real-time Pure Pursuit and PID (Proportional, Integral, Derivative) loops in C++ code.
ARC-OTG
Constructed a fully custom apparatus to allow a user to interact with games. Used electronic components such as a joystick and capacitive buttons to drive an operating system written in Python that ran internally on a Raspberry Pi 4 computer. Chassis was 3D-Printed, fully designed and built by a team of 2 including myself. Development required extensive knowledge in modeling with Autodesk Fusion, as well as code to interface with external hardware using General Purpose Input-Output pins on the circuit board.
OTHER PROJECTS
Rigid / Soft Dynamics Simulation
Demonstration of dynamics in a controlled environment for the purpose of simulating structural systems, from jelly-like substances to bridges with varying levels of strength and weight tolerance.

Simple Language Web (Ultra-Small Language Model)
Markov model enhanced with neural networks for the purpose of creating semi-intelligent phrases and sentences off of limited data. Written in Python and uses the Tensorflow ML library.

Cloud-Based Clicker and Information System [GameSync]
Developed a cloud-based real-time player clicker, score-monitoring, and information display system for the production of a YouTube gameshow. Incorporated wireless linking of devices, with all game functionality (score incrementing, question display, clicker function) all being handled automatically.

EXPERIENCE

Software Engineer
OasisNEU
Sept. 2024 – Dec. 2024 (anticipated)
Gained valuable professional experience working with a team of developers on a seamless workflow planning tool built with React. Collaboratively designed the user experience and functionality in Figma, getting feedback from team members until a development-ready design was achieved. Consulted with professionals via Oasis's mentor program, to design and develop a production-ready result.
Shift Leader / Crew Member
Dunkin'
Aug. 2022 – Feb. 2024
Served food & beverages, assisted crew members, managed daily branch revenues, cleaned & closed store.
ACCOMPLISHMENTS

VEX Robotics World Championship, Dallas TX
Obtained the THINK Award for creation of code that most effectively solves game challenges. Amongst the code that earned this recognition was the above autonomous path generation program (see: Projects).

Southern New England (VEX Robotics) Regional Championship, Bridgeport CT
Obtained the AMAZE Award, as well as achieving the 4th-highest Robot Skills Challenge score in the region. Amongst the code that contributed to this recognition was the development of an active obstacle avoidance algorithm to reduce unwanted collisions between the robot and its environment.

VEX Robotics 2023-2024 Season, "Over Under"
Achieved 15 Awards over 6 months of attending local, regional, and world-level competitions.

Robotics & Engineering Excellence Award
Received an award from the North Andover High School for showing great academic and competitive rigor via both the VEX Robotics program as well as personal computer science and engineering projects.

COMMUNITY WORK

Electronics I & II (High-School-Level Course)
Volunteered as an Alumni of the North Andover High School to design/create the curriculum for a basic electrical engineering and hardware-software interfacing class, which will be added in 2025. Worked with school administration to ensure the class follows rigorous standards of quality and introduced topics in an understandable manner.

Rotary International (Interact Club)
Worked with peers to research volunteer opportunities, and provided aid to local businesses. As an Interact alum I volunteered to digitize the resource network for student orgs. at the North Andover High School.
